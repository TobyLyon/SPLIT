# SplitSquads üöÄ

**Rewards-Sharing Social Staking on Solana**

SplitSquads is a production-ready, end-to-end decentralized application that implements rewards-sharing social staking on Solana. Users can form or join squads (2-8 members), stake $SPLIT tokens, and earn rewards based on dynamic weight calculations that consider stake amount, tenure, squad size, and activity scores.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Squad Formation**: Create or join squads with 2-8 members
- **Dynamic Weight System**: Earn rewards based on:
  - Base stake weight (proportional to stake amount)
  - Tenure multiplier (longer staking = higher rewards, capped at 2x after 90 days)
  - Squad size multiplier (larger squads get bonuses up to 1.2x for 8 members)
  - Activity multiplier (off-chain engagement score from 0.5x to 1.5x)
- **Competitive Leaderboards**: Global rankings for squads and individual members
- **Twitter Integration**: Proof-of-ownership verification via signed tweets
- **Glassmorphic UI**: Beautiful, modern interface with arcade-style micro-accents
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, Ledger, and more
- **Real-time Updates**: Live activity feeds and reward distributions

## üì¶ Project Structure

### Anchor Program (`/programs/splitsquads`)

The core Solana program implementing:
- Squad creation and management
- Member joining and leaving
- Token staking and unstaking
- Reward distribution with dynamic weights
- Activity score updates from oracle

**Key Instructions:**
- `initialize_squad`: Create a new squad
- `join_squad`: Join an existing squad
- `stake_tokens`: Stake $SPLIT tokens

```

- **BaseWeight**: Proportional to staked amount
- **TenureMultiplier**: 1.0x to 2.0x based on continuous staking duration
- **SquadMultiplier**: 1.0x to 1.2x based on squad size (2-8 members)
- **ActivityMultiplier**: 0.5x to 1.5x based on engagement score (0-100)
